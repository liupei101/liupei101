I am a 3th year Ph.D. Candidate advised by Prof. [Luping Ji](https://faculty.uestc.edu.cn/jiluping/zh_CN/index.htm) at [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/). Prior to starting my Ph.D., I obtained my B.S/M.S. in School of Computer Science and Engineering at University of Electronic Science and Technology of China. 

My research interests mainly lie in computational pathology (CPATH), multiple instance learning (MIL), survival analysis, and predictive uncertainty modeling.
