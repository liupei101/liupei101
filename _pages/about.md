I am a final-year Ph.D. Candidate advised by Prof. [Luping Ji](https://faculty.uestc.edu.cn/jiluping/zh_CN/index.htm) at [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/). Prior to starting my Ph.D., I obtained my B.E./M.S. in School of Computer Science and Engineering at [UESTC](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/) in 2017/2020. 

***Research Interest***: My research interests cover many aspects of machine learning and its applications in healthcare.
- Machine Learning: 1) **Multiple Instance Learning** (MIL), particularly in its instance-level learnability under weak supervision; 2) **Bayesian inference and uncertainty modeling**, with more focus on evidential deep learning (EDL); and 3) **Survival analysis**, mainly in unbiased modeling for censored individuals.
- **Computational Pathology** (CPATH): utilizing efficient deep learning methods and explainable tools to unlock the potiential of Whole-Slide Image (WSI) for precise and personalized cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. I would like to devote myself to this direction for a long term and focus on cutting-edge research. 

***Publication & Activities***: Most of my research papers have been published in interdisciplinary journals and computer science conferences, such as [ICML](https://openreview.net/group?id=ICML.cc), [IEEE TMI](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=42), and [MedIA](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/medical-image-analysis). A full publication list can be found at [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FNghdtEAAAAJ) or [here](https://liupei101.github.io/publications/). I also serve as reviewer in international conferences (ICLR, NeurIPS) and journals (IEEE TNNLS, IEEE JBHI, ESWA, Computers in Biology and Medicine). 

Feel free to contact me for possible communications or collaborations.

I am on job market now and expect to graduate in June 2025. I am seeking a post-doctoral opportunity, please contact me via [email](mailto:yuukilp@163.com) if you are interested.
