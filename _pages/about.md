I am a 3rd year Ph.D. Candidate advised by Prof. [Luping Ji](https://faculty.uestc.edu.cn/jiluping/zh_CN/index.htm) at [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/). Prior to starting my Ph.D., I obtained my B.E./M.S. in School of Computer Science and Engineering at University of Electronic Science and Technology of China. 

My research interests mainly lie in computational pathology (CPATH), multiple instance learning (MIL), survival analysis, predictive uncertainty, and multi-modal learning. Most of my research papers have been published in top-tier journals like IEEE TMI, MedIA, etc. I also serve as a regular reviewer in IEEE JBHI, Computers in Biology and Medicine, ESWA, etc.
